==============

Facebook like ALL freinds posts in PHP

This script will allow you to like everything your freinds post.
What a supportive person you are. You must have read Dale Carnegie.

This is written in PHP, so all you have to do is run a cron job for wherever you put it.
You need PHP installed, but should run on Windows, OSX and Linux.
Uses lib cURL.

Facebook SDK not required.
PHP curl support required.
Must create your own facebook app, which requires a facebook account (which, for some reason, may require a phone number, use a throwaway).
